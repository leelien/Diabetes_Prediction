# Diabetes_Prediction
#1 Business Understanding
#1.1 Overview
#Diabetes conditions can be defined ascharacterized by high blood sugar levels and is an endocrine and metabolic disorder. It can be classified as the top ten chronic diseases in the world. The main causes of this disease is hyposecretion of pancreatic islets or defects in insulin action. Once diagnosed, it will follow along the rest of life. Exploring the predisposing factors of diabetes has become a popular and important issue of people's attention. Therefore, exploring the important related features that cause diabetes has become our research topic. In this group project, we will use the diabetes dataset from Mendeley Data. Data analysis of variables such as sugar level blood, age, gender, creatinine ratio, Body Mass Index (BMI), urea, cholesterol, fasting lipid profile, cholesterol , HBA1 are the symptoms or early indicator to detect a person likelihood to get the diabetes or not.

#1.2 Problem Statement
#There were 463 million diabetics in 2019. If predictions are correct,this number will rise by 578 million by 2030, reaching 700 million by 2045 (Febrian, M. E., et al 2023). The ability of experts is required to determine the type of diabetes disease. Because of their delaying discovering what disease they have, many people who are examined have a disease that can be described as severe. Hence, the problem of delay in detection can increase the number of pateint who have diabetes not in early but after the severe stage. As a result, the selected diabetes dataset will use to predict the diabetes in advanced using different machine learning algorithms and we will choose the best models which have high accuracy for the diabetes prediction so that a can detect a person likelihood having diabetes accurately.

#1.2 Research Questions
#What symptoms or indicators can be considered as the important features in the diabetes prediction?
#How to predict the likelihood a person can get diabetes using machine learning models?
#What's the relationship between diabetes, age and BMI?
#What machine learning models shows the best models to predict the diabetes accurately ?

#1.3 Objectives
#To understand the correlation of the symptoms to the diabetes.
#To predict the likelihood of a person to get diabetes using machine learning model.
#To understand the relationship between diabetes,age and BMI.
#To determine the accurate machine learning model which can predict likelihood a person get diabetes accurately.

#1.4 Motivation
#Diabetes cause many health impacts such as:

#1. damaging the blood vessels
#2. nerves thus leading to heart attacks
#3. strokes
#4. blindness
#5. kidney failure.
#6. Risk of heart disease
#7. Pancrease malfunction

#Hence, early detection and diagnosis complication and save peoples life from this disease. However, the symptom of this disease is less marked. Therefore, it is hard to diagnosed even after the disease onset. In this case, an effective predicting model with high sensitivity and accuracy is much needed. This is to provide a better identification of the potential risk to onset diabetes before get worst
